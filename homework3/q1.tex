\begin{theorem}
    Using induction, prove that for all even natural numbers \emph{n}, the integer
    $n^3 + 2n^2 - 32$ is divisible by 8.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let the theorem be $P(n) = n^3 + 2n^2 - 32$. We first consider the base case $P(2)$
    and then the induction hypothesis where for a given even natural number $k$:
    \[
        P(k) \implies P(k + 2)
    \]

    \noindent\textit{Base Case.} Considering $P(2)$:
    \[
        P(2) = 2^3 + 2(2)^2 - 32 = 8 + 8 - 32 = -16
    \]
    Which is divisible by 8, so the base case holds.

    \noindent\textit{Induction Step.} We consider the induction hypothesis:
    \[
        P(k) \implies P(k + 2) \text{ where $k$ is an even natural number}
    \]

    It follows:
    
    \begin{align*}
        (k + 2)^3 + 2(k + 2)^2 - 32 & = (k^3 + 2k^2 + 4k^2 + 8k + 4k + 8) + (2k^2 + 8k + 8) - 32\\
        & = (k^3 + 2k^2 - 32) + 6k^2 + 20k + 16
    \end{align*}

    Assuming that $(k^3 + 2k^2 - 32)$ is divisible by 8, it suffices to prove that $6k^2 + 20k + 16$
    is divisible by 8.

    Since $k$ is even, we can express $k$ as $2m$, where $m$ is a natural number. We can thus express
    $6k^2$ and $20k$ as $6(2m)^2$ and $20(2m)$ respectively.

    Then
    \[
        6k^2 + 20k + 16 = 6(2m)^2 + 20(2m) + 16 = 24m^2 + 40m + 16 = 8(3m^2 + 5m + 2)
    \]

    Since $\N$ is closed under multiplication, $3m^2 + 5m + 2$ is a natural, thus
    $8(3m^2 + 5m + 2)$ is divisible by 8, proving the induction hypothesis.

    By PMI, since the base case and induction hypothesis hold, we have proved the theorem, as
    required.
\end{proof}
